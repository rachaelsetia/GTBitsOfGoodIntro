            <p>Hi! I'm excited to have the opportunity to join the Bits of Good team!</p>

            <button class="accordion">About Me</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>My name is Rachael Setia, and I'm from Raleigh, North Carolina! I'm a first year student majoring in Computer Science with the Intelligence and Media threads with a planned graduation date of May 2028. I'm also pursuing a minor in Biology because of my interest in computational biology and bioinformatics. I'm hoping to later do the BSMS program here at Georgia Tech!</p>

                    I love serving my community :&rpar;
                    <br> Since I was in middle school, I've always been involved in efforts to give back to my community and better it in any way that I can. In high school, I committed to doing this by volunteering at UNC Rex Hospital to help out the large workload of doctors and nurses as well as by helping out at Second Chance Pet Adoptions, a local animal rescue with a mission to save animals on the brink of euthanization. In addition, I worked to spread my passion for STEM through the many outreaches that my robotics team and I did. We worked with local organizations and museums to participate or host events that would expose the local community, especially children, to the wonders of STEM and the possibilities that await them. I hope that, through Bits of Good, I can continue to serve my community as well as the organizations that support this community.
